predictModel_gbm        This function reads the GBM model from the data
                        directory and then predict the outcome based on
                        the test data set.
predictModel_glm        This function reads the GLM model from the data
                        directory and then predict the outcome based on
                        the test data set.
predictModel_nnet       This function reads the Neural Network model
                        from the data directory and then predict the
                        outcome based on the test data set.
predictModel_rf         This function reads the Random Forest model
                        from the data directory and then predict the
                        outcome based on the test data set.
readprojectpath         This function reads the project location from
                        user and return the path to the caller.
train_model             The function train_model reads the data from
                        the csv file, apply multiple models and save
                        the models output as .rds files.
