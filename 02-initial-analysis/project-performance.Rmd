## Initial Analysis

I looked at the data set and the data set is ; separated. It has proper feature label and target table. So, no need to clean this data.  I divided the data set into two set, 80% of the data for Training the model and 20% for testing the model.

## Training data performance

Call:
 randomForest(formula = y ~ age + job + marital + education +      default + balance + housing + loan + contact + duration +      campaign + pdays + previous + poutcome, data = train_data) 
               Type of random forest: classification
                     Number of trees: 500
No. of variables tried at each split: 3

        OOB estimate of  error rate: 10.66%
Confusion matrix:

pred |no| yes |class.error
-----|--|-----|-----------
no   |3123|  84|   0.0261927
yes  |303 | 119|   0.7180095


We can see that 500 trees were build, and the model randomly sampled 3 predictors at each split. It also shows a matrix containing prediction vs actual, as well as classification error for each class.

Calcualted the training accuracy using this confusion matrix and the accuracy is 89.76%

## Testing model performance

Predicted the target using the testing data set which is 20% of the entire data set and then computed the confusion matrix.

Test data confusion matrix

pred  | no |yes
----- |----|----
  no  |798 |76
  yes |29  |34
  
The accuracy of the testing data set is   88.79%

We have achieved more than 88% accuracy with very simple model. It could be further improved by feature selection,and possibly by trying different
